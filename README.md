# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

For this analysis, we are working at Pyber as a data analyst conducting an exploratory analysis on ridesharing data. 

We will examine three city types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban.  
Within those categories we will look at:
  - Total Rides
  - Total Fares
  - Total Drivers
  - Average Fare per Ride
  - Average Fare per Driver

We will also create a new Dataframe to show the fares between January 1st, 2019 and April 29th, 2019. With this information, we will create a line chart depicting the differences in fare by city type.
 
- Resources:
  - Python, Pandas Library, Matplotlib
  - ride_data.csv and city_data.csv
